    <p>Most startup advice is about strategy, metrics, hiring. Very little about how people <em>feel</em> — and yet feelings are usually what determines whether a team ships or stalls.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this a lot lately, partly because I keep seeing the same pattern play out across startups I&rsquo;ve worked with. And partly because of something I learned years ago in Ronald Heifetz&rsquo;s class at the Kennedy School that I keep coming back to — his framework on adaptive leadership crystallized something I&rsquo;d been struggling to articulate.</p>
<h2 id="the-scene">The Scene</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a scenario that plays out constantly:</p>
<p>A cofounder throws out &ldquo;what if we pivot to X?&rdquo; in a Monday standup. To him, he&rsquo;s brainstorming. He&rsquo;s being transparent, thinking out loud, inviting debate. That&rsquo;s what cofounders are supposed to do, right?</p>
<p>But the founding engineer who&rsquo;s been heads-down building for six months hears something completely different. He hears: <em>my work might be worthless.</em> He doesn&rsquo;t push back — not because he agrees, but because there&rsquo;s a power dynamic he can feel but can&rsquo;t quite name. The person who controls his equity just casually suggested his last six months don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>The cofounder walks away thinking &ldquo;great brainstorm.&rdquo; The engineer goes quiet, starts updating his LinkedIn, and ships a little slower each week. Nobody talks about why.</p>
<p>Neither person is wrong. But something important just broke, and neither of them has the language for it.</p>
<h2 id="why-change-is-hard-even-when-its-right">Why Change Is Hard (Even When It&rsquo;s Right)</h2>
<p>This is where Heifetz helped me see something I&rsquo;d been missing. He draws a distinction between two kinds of problems:</p>
<p><strong>Technical problems</strong> have known solutions. The server&rsquo;s down — fix it. You need a CFO — hire one. These are hard but straightforward. Apply expertise, solve problem.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptive challenges</strong> are different. They require people to change their beliefs, habits, or identity. Pivoting the product. Shifting from founder-led sales to a sales team. Confronting a cofounder about performance. These don&rsquo;t have a playbook. They require people to let go of something — and that letting go is where everything gets stuck.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing most founders miss: <strong>people don&rsquo;t resist change because they&rsquo;re weak. They resist because change means loss.</strong></p>
<p>That engineer isn&rsquo;t being &ldquo;sensitive.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s processing real losses — six months of work, his identity as the technical architect, his sense of control over the product&rsquo;s direction. You can&rsquo;t logic someone through that. It has to be metabolized.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what most people miss about high-growth startups: they aren&rsquo;t a series of stable periods interrupted by occasional change. <strong>A high-growth startup is one long, continuous adaptive challenge.</strong> Every quarter, roles shift. The engineer who was a generalist now needs to be a manager. The cofounder who did everything now needs to delegate. The scrappy sales process needs to become a real team. The whole company needs to re-learn how it works, over and over, at a pace most people have never experienced.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a bug — that&rsquo;s what growth looks like from the inside. And treating these constant adaptive challenges like technical ones — just make the rational decision and move on — is how you end up with a team that looks aligned in meetings and falls apart everywhere else.</p>
<h2 id="the-thermometer-youre-not-reading">The Thermometer You&rsquo;re Not Reading</h2>
<p>Heifetz talks about the leader&rsquo;s job as managing the &ldquo;productive zone of disequilibrium.&rdquo; Think of it as a thermometer:</p>
<p><strong>Too cold:</strong> Everyone&rsquo;s comfortable. No urgency. &ldquo;Things are fine&rdquo; when they&rsquo;re clearly not. You&rsquo;re burning runway while the team optimizes things that don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p><strong>Too hot:</strong> Panic. People shut down, get political, or leave. You&rsquo;ve pushed so hard and so fast that nobody can think straight.</p>
<p><strong>The sweet spot:</strong> Uncomfortable but not overwhelmed. This is where growth happens — where people are stretched enough to change but supported enough to not break.</p>
<p>The cofounder in our story cranked the heat to maximum without realizing he was holding the dial. That&rsquo;s the thing about power dynamics in startups — cofounders often don&rsquo;t realize they can&rsquo;t &ldquo;just brainstorm&rdquo; anymore. Their words carry weight they didn&rsquo;t ask for and might not want. A casual &ldquo;what if&rdquo; from the person who signs the checks lands very differently than the same words from a peer.</p>
<h2 id="feelings-are-data-not-noise">Feelings Are Data, Not Noise</h2>
<p>Startup culture fetishizes rationality. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be emotional.&rdquo; &ldquo;Move fast.&rdquo; &ldquo;Data-driven decisions.&rdquo; But feelings are the data that tells you the temperature.</p>
<p>Anxiety in the team? You might be moving too fast or not communicating enough context. Apathy? Not enough urgency, or people don&rsquo;t understand why their work matters. Conflict? Could be productive friction — or a sign you have a values problem you&rsquo;re not addressing.</p>
<p>Ignoring feelings doesn&rsquo;t make them go away. They leak out as passive aggression, quiet quitting, hallway politics, and slow-rolling decisions. The engineer in our story didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;I feel threatened.&rdquo; He just&hellip; disengaged. And by the time that&rsquo;s visible in the metrics, it&rsquo;s usually too late.</p>
<h2 id="high-performance--no-friction">High Performance ≠ No Friction</h2>
<p>This is where people get confused. Psychological safety — Amy Edmondson&rsquo;s term — doesn&rsquo;t mean everyone&rsquo;s comfortable all the time. It means people feel safe enough to take risks, disagree, and say &ldquo;that scares me and here&rsquo;s why&rdquo; without it being career suicide.</p>
<p>The best startup teams I&rsquo;ve seen run hot. They argue, they challenge, they move fast. But they do it inside a container where people trust that the discomfort is in service of something, not just chaos.</p>
<p>Heifetz calls this the &ldquo;holding environment&rdquo; — the structure that lets people do hard work without falling apart. In practice, it&rsquo;s less mystical than it sounds. It&rsquo;s a cofounder who says &ldquo;I want to stress-test our direction — nothing is decided, I need your honest take&rdquo; before riffing on pivots. It&rsquo;s separating <em>exploring ideas</em> from <em>making decisions</em> and being explicit about which one you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s the whole trick. Frame before you explore. Name which mode you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<h2 id="managing-the-rate-of-change">Managing the Rate of Change</h2>
<p>Your job as a leader isn&rsquo;t to eliminate discomfort — it&rsquo;s to make sure your team can absorb the rate of change the business demands. And in a high-growth startup, that rate is relentless.</p>
<p>This means you&rsquo;re not &ldquo;managing through a change&rdquo; like it&rsquo;s a one-time event. You&rsquo;re constantly calibrating: How much can this team take right now? What do they need to let go of this month? Have they processed the last shift enough to handle the next one?</p>
<p><strong>Name what&rsquo;s being lost.</strong> Every time a role changes, a product pivots, or a process gets replaced — something dies. Someone&rsquo;s identity, someone&rsquo;s work, someone&rsquo;s comfort. &ldquo;I know this means some of what you built won&rsquo;t ship as-is.&rdquo; People can handle hard news. What they can&rsquo;t handle is pretending there&rsquo;s no cost.</p>
<p><strong>Sequence the losses.</strong> Don&rsquo;t drop the pivot, the reorg, and the new OKRs in the same week. People can metabolize one hard thing at a time. Stack them and they shut down.</p>
<p><strong>Decide and move.</strong> Psychological safety doesn&rsquo;t mean consensus. You can acknowledge the cost and still make the hard call. In fact, that&rsquo;s exactly what good leadership is — being honest about the tradeoffs and then deciding anyway. The acknowledgment is what earns you the speed.</p>
<h2 id="why-startups-get-this-wrong">Why Startups Get This Wrong</h2>
<p>Founders are selected for conviction and speed — the opposite of what adaptive leadership requires. You got funded because you had a bold vision and the intensity to pursue it. Nobody invests in &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to carefully regulate my team&rsquo;s emotional temperature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>VC pressure makes it worse. When you&rsquo;re burning $200K a month, slowing down to acknowledge feelings seems like a luxury. But the irony is that ignoring the emotional reality is what actually slows you down — through turnover, through disengagement, through teams that nod in meetings and drag their feet everywhere else.</p>
<p>And &ldquo;culture&rdquo; gets reduced to perks and values posters instead of the actual emotional reality of how people work together. Your culture isn&rsquo;t your ping pong table. It&rsquo;s what happens when the cofounder throws out a pivot idea on a Monday morning.</p>
<h2 id="the-point">The Point</h2>
<p>The best founders I&rsquo;ve worked with aren&rsquo;t the ones who move fastest. They&rsquo;re the ones who know when to turn up the heat and when to let the room cool down. They understand that every strategic change has a human cost, and that pretending otherwise doesn&rsquo;t make them tough — it makes them blind.</p>
<p>Leadership isn&rsquo;t having the vision. It&rsquo;s having the courage to sit in the discomfort with your team while you figure it out together. And sometimes, it&rsquo;s as simple as saying: &ldquo;I know this is hard. Here&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re doing it anyway. Tell me what you&rsquo;re worried about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not soft. That&rsquo;s how you build a team that can actually survive the thing you&rsquo;re building together.</p>
