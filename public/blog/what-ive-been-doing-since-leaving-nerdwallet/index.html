  <section><p>After nearly 6 years building NerdWallet, I left at the end of March to move back to my home country, Singapore. It&rsquo;s been nearly 18 years since I first arrived in the US to start university at Stanford. I never imagined I would be here so long, and now it&rsquo;s time to begin navigating my return.</p>
<p><strong>My motivation:</strong> I have an almost-two year old daughter - I want her to experience growing up in a safe place, surrounded by family in a geography that is poised to experience a ton of secular growth. I want her to know what real char kway teow tastes like =). I don&rsquo;t want to worry that she&rsquo;s going to be shot in school by some crazy person. =(</p>
<p><strong>People&rsquo;s reactions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>My American friends: &ldquo;What a great adventure! Is this forever? Can we come too?&rdquo;</li>
<li>My Singaporean friends: &ldquo;Huh? Why you come home? California is so nice&rdquo;</li>
<li>Singaporean taxi drivers: &ldquo;Why? In America, don&rsquo;t have to work can collect welfare, what&rdquo; He refused to believe me when I said that being poor in America is actually pretty terrible</li>
<li>Singaporean civil servants: &ldquo;Good, nice to have Singaporeans come home&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My process:</strong> I&rsquo;ve been spending the last 5 months traveling in the region, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, meeting entrepreneurs and investors, trying to build a mental model of what I think is exciting and fun to do, and where I can be of service. I was basically choosing between a) joining a company, b) starting a business, and c) raising a fund. After over 100+ conversations, I finally decided to join two of my oldest friends, Elizabeth Yin and Eric Bahn at their new pre-seed fund, Hustle Fund. More on that decision in my next blog post!</p>
<p><strong>Upcoming blog topics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Why I joined Hustle Fund</em></li>
<li><em>Why operators should do angel investing</em></li>
<li><em>Why women should take more risk in their portfolios</em></li>
<li><em>Communication - why you have to say everything more than once, in multiple channels</em></li>
</ul>
