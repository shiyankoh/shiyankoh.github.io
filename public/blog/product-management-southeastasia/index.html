<p>Last night, I had the privilege of moderating a panel hosted by <a href="https://www.womenpm.org/">Women in Product</a>, where we explored what product management <em>was</em> to our panelists, as well as perspectives on growth, metrics, localisation and careers. It was a broad-ranging conversation, appropriate given the wide range of experiences of our panelists. We probably could have spent 30 minutes on each topic alone!</p>
<p>I shared the definition of product management that I like best, shamelessly pilfered from Gib Biddle, fmr VP Product @ Netflix, who I worked with at NerdWallet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Delight customers, in hard to copy, margin-enhancing ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Customer delight and customer centricity is often cited as a key value of a business, yet we see a ton of products that are shipped that almost seem dis-interested in the end user experience. Yet delight alone does not make a great business, and at the end of the day, if you create an amazing product, that no one is willing to pay for, or that is easily replicable, I would consider that a failure of product management.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reshmiroy/">Reshmi Roy</a> of Skyscanner shared her experiences on how to incubate new markets when working for a global business, and the challenges of dealing with a centralized product team, when localisation is required, be it from a product feature or channel perspective. The call out of channel is particularly apt, because first-time PMs and founders often focus on product and neglect distribution.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/annagong/">Anna Gong</a> of Perx shared the challenges of pivoting Perx from a B2C to a B2B business. It&rsquo;s a nice example of <em>founder-market fit</em>, given Anna&rsquo;s past experiences in Enterprise sales and business development, she was able to see that the core rewards/loyalty platform they had built was much more valuable to enterprises with large customer bases, legacy systems, and no vendors, than their initial SME market.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/radhika-dutt/">Radhika Dutt</a> emphasised the importance of being true to one&rsquo;s product vision, and the dangers of being entranced by metrics that are not appropriate to the stage of product development you may be in.</p>
<p>Turnout was fantastic, ~100 women <em>and</em> men in the audience. It skewed towards folks wanting to get into the discipline, which I see as a great sign for the vibrance of the region. Props to Christine Sou and Deepika Murthy (Singapore chapter leads) for pulling this together.</p>
