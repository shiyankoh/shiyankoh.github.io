A good group chat runs on collegiality — people sharing what they&rsquo;ve learned, building on each other&rsquo;s thinking, assuming good intent. Nobody&rsquo;s pulling rank because nobody needs to. The ideas speak for themselves.</p><p>But get the dynamics wrong, and you end up in a place where people are defending their right to have an opinion instead of actually exchanging them. The magic is gone, and it&rsquo;s very hard to get back.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been in a lot of group chats — mostly on WhatsApp — and the gap between the great ones and the terrible ones is enormous. It comes down to three things: who&rsquo;s in the room, who set the tone, and whether people are advancing the conversation or just occupying space in it.</p><h2 id=composition-is-casting>Composition is casting</h2><p>A group chat is like casting a movie. Every person you add changes the dynamic.</p><p>The best groups I&rsquo;ve been in share a specific context. Not &ldquo;people who are generally interesting&rdquo; — people working on the same thing <em>right now</em>.</p><p>Take the Claude Code groups I&rsquo;m in. The ones that work aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;AI enthusiasts.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re people actively building with the same tool, hitting the same walls, at roughly the same skill level. Someone posts a problem, three people recognize it because they hit it last Tuesday.</p><p>The ones that don&rsquo;t work split between people who joined &ldquo;to learn&rdquo; and deep practitioners. Neither group gets what they need.</p><p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean small is always better. A 200-person group can work — but the shared context has to be sharper to compensate for the size.</p><h2 id=you-built-it-you-own-it>You built it. You own it.</h2><p>If you created the group, you&rsquo;re the culture setter. The first week is wet concrete.</p><p><strong>Model what you want.</strong> If you want high-signal posts, your first ten messages better be high-signal. People don&rsquo;t read rules. They read the room.</p><p><strong>Be opinionated early.</strong> The instinct is to be welcoming — &ldquo;share whatever!&rdquo; — but that&rsquo;s how you get noise. <em>This group is for X. We talk about Y. When you share something, include Z.</em> People don&rsquo;t resent opinionated norms. They&rsquo;re relieved by them. Walking into a group with clear expectations is easier than guessing what&rsquo;s appropriate.</p><p><strong>Onboard into the culture, not just the group.</strong> When someone new joins a group that&rsquo;s been running for months, they see a wall of messages and have to guess. A quick DM — &ldquo;here&rsquo;s what this group is about, here&rsquo;s how we use it&rdquo; — takes 30 seconds and prevents weeks of drift.</p><p><strong>Prune.</strong> Sometimes the dynamic shifts because of one or two people who don&rsquo;t match the culture. Your job is to address it — privately, directly, kindly. Most people won&rsquo;t, which is why most large groups eventually degrade.</p><h2 id=large-groups-more-surface-area-more-risk>Large groups: more surface area, more risk</h2><p>Small groups are forgiving. In a 100+ person chat, one tangent buries an important thread under 60 messages in twenty minutes.</p><p>Lurkers being the majority is fine — it&rsquo;s the model. A large group is part conversation, part ambient knowledge feed. But one loud voice has outsized impact. In a 6-person chat, someone who responds to everything is annoying. In a 150-person chat, they set the culture.</p><p>And the death spiral is specific: quality drops → best contributors go quiet → casual members mute → the only people left talking are the ones who drove everyone else out. By the time you notice, it&rsquo;s too late.</p><p>WhatsApp makes this harder — no threads. Every tangent plays out in the main chat. Two people going back and forth about something niche can bury a question the whole group would&rsquo;ve benefited from answering.</p><h2 id=advance-the-ball-dont-occupy-the-airspace>Advance the ball, don&rsquo;t occupy the airspace</h2><p>Think of a group chat like a soccer match. The best players receive the ball, advance it, and pass. They don&rsquo;t dribble in circles at midfield.</p><p>Advancing the ball: adding information nobody had. Asking a question that sharpens the discussion. &ldquo;I tried that — here&rsquo;s what happened.&rdquo;</p><p>Occupying the airspace: restating what someone said, slightly rephrased. Reacting to every message. Writing paragraphs when a sentence would do.</p><p>The worst behavior is the person who responds to everything but advances nothing. The chat <em>feels</em> active but is actually useless. Thirty new messages, and you close it knowing exactly as much as before. In a small group, that&rsquo;s annoying. In a large group, it&rsquo;s fatal — because the people who <em>do</em> advance the ball feel drowned out, so they stop. Then all you have left is noise.</p><p>The best contributors are often the quietest. They lurk for 20 messages, then drop one that changes the direction of the conversation.</p><p>A good group chat culture gives people permission to not respond. An emoji reaction is almost always better than a message that says &ldquo;great point.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=the-real-test>The real test</h2><p>The test of a good group isn&rsquo;t how many messages it generates. It&rsquo;s whether people open it on purpose — not to clear a notification, but because they want to see what&rsquo;s there.</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=container>&copy; 2026 Shiyan Koh</div></footer></body></html>
