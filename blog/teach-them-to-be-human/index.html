AI Will Handle the Rest.</h1><div class=post-date>February 26, 2026</div></div><div class=post-content><p>Every parent I know is asking some version of the same question: what should we actually be teaching our kids now that AI can do&mldr; most things?</p><p>It&rsquo;s not a theoretical question for me. I have three kids. The oldest is nine. By the time she enters the workforce, the landscape will be unrecognizable. So what do I optimize for?</p><p>Not coding. AI writes code better than most humans already. Not memorization. AI has perfect recall. Not even &ldquo;STEM&rdquo; as a blanket answer — because the rote parts of STEM are exactly what gets automated first.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s what I keep coming back to.</p><p><strong>Persuasion.</strong> AI can generate a perfect pitch deck. It cannot look across the table and feel that someone&rsquo;s afraid. The most persuasive people I&rsquo;ve met aren&rsquo;t the ones with the best arguments — they&rsquo;re the ones who sense what someone needs to hear before they know it themselves. That&rsquo;s not logic. It&rsquo;s attunement. Reading the room, feeling the tension, knowing when to push and when to sit in silence. Persuasion that actually moves people starts with emotional awareness — understanding <em>where someone is</em> before trying to take them somewhere else. AI will make everyone&rsquo;s arguments sharper. The edge will belong to people who know how to make others <em>feel</em> understood.</p><p><strong>Collaboration.</strong> AI is a solo force multiplier. But the hardest problems aren&rsquo;t technical — they&rsquo;re human. A team falling apart because two people won&rsquo;t say what&rsquo;s actually bothering them. A project stalling because someone feels unheard and has checked out. Collaboration isn&rsquo;t project management. It&rsquo;s emotional labor. It&rsquo;s noticing when someone&rsquo;s energy shifts in a meeting. It&rsquo;s having the conversation nobody wants to have. It&rsquo;s holding space for disagreement without letting it curdle into resentment. Kids who learn to sit with discomfort — their own and other people&rsquo;s — will be able to do things AI never will.</p><p><strong>Curiosity.</strong> The kids who thrive won&rsquo;t be the ones who were forced to learn. They&rsquo;ll be the ones who <em>wanted</em> to. Curiosity is the engine. Without it, AI is a toy. With it, AI is a superpower. A curious kid with access to AI can teach themselves almost anything. An incurious kid with the same access will use it to cheat on homework.</p><p><strong>The belief you can learn anything.</strong> This might matter most. Not &ldquo;you&rsquo;re smart&rdquo; — that&rsquo;s fragile. But &ldquo;you can figure this out if you&rsquo;re willing to put in the work.&rdquo; The rate of change means constant relearning. Kids who believe they can adapt will. Kids who&rsquo;ve been told they&rsquo;re either gifted or not will freeze.</p><p><strong>Agency.</strong> The willingness to act without being told. To see a problem and start solving it. AI lowers every barrier to building — but someone still has to decide to build. Agency is the difference between a kid who consumes and a kid who creates.</p><h2 id=so-where-does-school-fit>So where does school fit?</h2><p>School still matters. You need foundational knowledge. You can&rsquo;t think critically about nothing — you need facts, frameworks, context to reason with. Reading, writing, math, science — these aren&rsquo;t obsolete. They&rsquo;re the substrate everything else runs on.</p><p>The question isn&rsquo;t whether school matters. It&rsquo;s whether school as currently designed <em>builds</em> or <em>breaks</em> the skills that matter most.</p><p>Because here&rsquo;s the tension: school is great at building foundational knowledge. School is also great at crushing curiosity, agency, and self-belief.</p><p>Standardized tests reward compliance, not curiosity. Grades reward right answers, not interesting questions. The kid who asks &ldquo;why?&rdquo; too many times gets labeled difficult. The kid who colors inside the lines gets praised.</p><p>How do you build knowledge without killing the drive to use it?</p><h2 id=some-stress-is-good-but-how-much>Some stress is good. But how much?</h2><p>This is the part I wrestle with most.</p><p>Kids need challenge. Struggle builds resilience, grit, the belief that hard things are possible. A kid who&rsquo;s never uncomfortable never grows. Shielding them from difficulty isn&rsquo;t kindness — it&rsquo;s deprivation.</p><p>But there&rsquo;s a line. Too much pressure doesn&rsquo;t build resilience. It builds anxiety, avoidance, learned helplessness. And the line is different for every kid — which makes it impossible to systematize, which is exactly what school tries to do.</p><p>The right amount of stress: enough that they stretch, not so much that they break. Enough that they fail sometimes and discover they can recover. That&rsquo;s where growth lives.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t have answers. I have experiments.</p><p>Expose them to hard things early, with support. Celebrate effort and process, not just outcomes. Let them use AI as a tool, but make sure they understand what&rsquo;s happening underneath. And above all — protect curiosity. A curious kid with foundational knowledge and agency will figure out the rest.</p><p>The skills that matter in the AI age aren&rsquo;t new. Persuasion, collaboration, curiosity, agency, the belief you can learn anything — these have always mattered.</p><p>What&rsquo;s new is that everything else is getting automated.</p><p>These aren&rsquo;t soft skills anymore. They&rsquo;re the only skills.</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=container>&copy; 2026 Shiyan Koh</div></footer></body></html>
