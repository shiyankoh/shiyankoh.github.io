A new year is always a great opportunity to reflect and set some goals - inspired by Der Shing's [blog](https://limdershing.blogspot.com), thought it useful to jot down priorities and give myself a chance to check back in a year to see how well I did against my stated intentions.

## Priorities

- **Health**
  - Improve sleep quality
  - Improve VO2max

- **Relationships** - Quality time focus
  - Kids
  - K
  - Parents

- **Work**
  - Time blocking more aggressively — Using [Flow Club](https://flow.club)
  - Building more process/automation/async comms — Using [Async](https://async.com) & [Loom](https://loom.com)

- **Community Building**
  - [Q Chamber](https://www.qchamber.co)
  - [Stanford Alumni Board](https://groups.stanford.edu/topics/4360/feed)
  - Tech Salon
  - People You Should Know (new)

- **Learning**
