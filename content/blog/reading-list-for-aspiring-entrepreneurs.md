I recently met with an incoming MBA student, who is leaving his cushy PE job for business school so that he can start something of his own. He asked if I had any recommendations on a) how to optimize his business school experience to best prepare himself for entrepreneurship, and b) if I had any books to recommend. It's something that's been on my mind as I've just finished teaching a 12 week [product management class](https://www.bigstartupschool.com/) at Singapore Management University and one of the major challenges has been for me to impart the context and experiences of 20 years spent in Silicon Valley.

In teaching the product management class, I realized I had been a little over-ambitious, and that there were actually **three** major bodies of knowledge hidden under the umbrella of ***product management,*** which we define as "Delighting customers, in hard to copy, margin-enhancing ways" (credit to Gib Biddle, fmr VP Product at Netflix for this pithy formulation)

1. **Business models and business history** - Why? If you haven't spent a lot of time thinking about what makes businesses successful, it can be useful to immerse yourself in business history as well as some classic business frameworks to begin developing your own ideas on the type of business you might want to create.
2. **Customer and user research, behavioural psychology** - Why? Building a business is ultimately about finding a problem that customers have that you can solve. This involves developing a deep insight into a specific problem, and the existing psychology around how it's solved currently, and what you can do better. Often people see a gap (business need), but don't spend enough time on customer research to develop the deep customer insight that you can anchor a product around.
3. **The practice and discipline of product management** - Why? There are best practices in building and shipping technology products; particularly as a resource-strapped startup. Don't get stuck in common ruts, develop frameworks to make product decisions when you have incredibly little information / learn how to get feedback quickly!

This is just the beginning! Read widely and enjoy the ride =). The one other thing I'd recommend is following interesting product, engineering and design leaders on Twitter. Often the folks I learn the most from are not the most high-profile senior folks, but those who are practitioners of the craft looking to share their thoughts and new discoveries with the community.
